## Lessons Learned

**Day 1**

I always get confused when I come across the credentials I need to provide for a Snowflake account. At first, I tried entering the full URL — and bam! I got an error. Thankfully, after some hands-on learning, I was able to understand the difference between the account name, account locator, and organization. Once I entered the account locator, my Day 1 challenge worked perfectly.

**Day 2**

A reminder to self--
Special way to run streamlit app is
streamlit run <project folder>/StreamlitAIChallenge/Streamlitday2.py

AIComplete is the latest version of Complete and is stateless. Given model and prompt, it generates responses based on text or image or graphs etc.
